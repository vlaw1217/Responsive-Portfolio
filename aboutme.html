        <h2>I want to be a web developer</h2>
    </div>



    <div class="detail">
        <p> I am originally from Hong Kong. I have lived in Toronto for about 15 years. For my
            past seven
            years, I was
            working at
            Cathay Pacific Airways as a customer service office. My job was mostly at the counter doing check-in
            procedure
            and
            ticketing issues.


            I want to change my job because I foresee this kind of job would not be last long in the next ten
            years.
            Everything is
            self could do, self check-in at kiosk, self bag drop and even the ticketing problems. People could
            do it
            online
            by
            themselves nowadays.


            Another reason I want to change my job because I love animals more than human. I used to interact
            different kind
            of
            people in my job. I would say I see a lot of "human ugliness". Communicate with animals or would be
            more
            comfortable for
            me. At least, I could act to be myself. Thats why I hope to find another job that it maybe has
            sustainable
            development
            and
            I am also interested in. Finally, I found it â€” its a web developer.


            Because of my recent job, I had many chances to visit a lot of countries. Especially last
            year,
            after my
            parent
            were taken by
            cancers within two years. It struck me heavily and I lost myself. Luckily, I have a lovely cat and my
            husband is always by
            my
            side. He
            accompanied me to travel Australia, China, and Argentina in last year. I did a lot of fun things
            that I
            have
            never dream
            of. I did sky diving in Australia. I walked the great wall in Beijing and it was my first time
            visiting
            South
            America.



            I love creative and willing to try many new things. Challenging is my favourite. Therefore, I
            quitted my
            job
            and
            attend the
            coding boot camp in UofT. I am completely new about it and sometimes feel overwhelming but it is fun
            and
            interesting. I
            put over 10 hours for practicing everyday because I hope it would be filled up my lacking. I know it
            will take
            time but
            I feel confident and I hope I would have opportunities to try it out.
